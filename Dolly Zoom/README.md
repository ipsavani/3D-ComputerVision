- Dolly zoom effect:
  - take as input a projection matrix and transform the given 3D point cloud into a 2D image.
  - Design a sequence of projection matrices corresponding to each frame of a "dolly zoom" capture sequence and effect.
  - render each of the individual images and create a video illustrating the effect.
